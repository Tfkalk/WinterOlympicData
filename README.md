# WinterOlympicData
This is data on the Winter Olympics, currently from 1924-2014. Feel free to update data as more Olympics occur.

Country Breakdown shows how many medals every country has won at every winter Olympics. For Olympics before that country participated, there are no values. Currently, it has zeroes to fill every space to its right (as in, West Germany has a 0 in 2014).
Host Bump shows how many medals the host country won during their Olympics and the one prior and after.
Both are broken down into Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Total.

2018 data will eventually be necessary!
